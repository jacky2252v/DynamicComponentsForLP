/**
 * GlitchText Component
 * 
 * A React component that applies a stylish, animated "glitch" effect to any text.
 * This component supports both dark and light themes, and leverages pseudo-elements
 * (`::before` and `::after`) with `clip-path` animations to create the distortion illusion.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Fully responsive and customizable via Tailwind utility classes (`text-5xl`, etc.)
 * - Works with both dark and light themes by styling accordingly
 * - Accepts any React children as its content
 * - Uses a `data-text` attribute for glitch layers to match the original text
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * ```tsx
 * <GlitchText>Hello World</GlitchText>
 * ```
 * 
 * Optionally, pass your own custom Tailwind classes:
 * 
 * ```tsx
 * <GlitchText className="text-4xl text-red-500">Glitched Out</GlitchText>
 * ```
 */

/**
*How it works (CSS-side):
*The .glitch-text class uses ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to duplicate the text.
*
*These layers are offset slightly and colored (green + magenta for dark mode, more subtle in light mode).
*
*clip-path animations randomly "slice" the text to simulate distortion.
*
*Works seamlessly across themes using .dark and .light class targeting.
