TextScrambler Component

A React component that animates a "hacker-style" text scramble effect on mouse hover. 
When the user hovers over the text, each character rapidly cycles through random symbols, numbers, and letters before settling back into the original text.    

Features:  
- Supports any string passed as children  
- Prevents overlapping animations using useRef  
- Fully resets to original text after animation  
- Cleans up intervals on unmount to prevent memory leaks    

Usage:  
<TextScrambler>HELLO WORLD</TextScrambler>
